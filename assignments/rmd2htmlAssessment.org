#+Title: An Rmd and Html Export - Assessment

* Task
  1. Add to your Rmd file
     - a simple function definition as illustrated in the lessons and videos,
     - a code block that uses your function to produce output,
     - and a ~for~ loop that counts from 1 to 10 and prints out the even numbers.
  2. Verify that you can use your Rmd file to export an Html file that opens in your browser and displays correctly.

* Comments
  To progress in our use of RStudio, R, programming, and markdown for generating reproducible research reports we will use the Rmd file from [[file:~/gitRepos/Intro2Computing4Psychology/assignments/firstRmdAssessment.org][the first Rmd assessment]] and expand it with some minimal code and export it.
